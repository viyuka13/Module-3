# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
        numbers = [1,5,6,7,20,25,30]
        total = sum(numbers)
        print(total)
        
## Output

## Result
The Python program to calculate the sum of a list of numbers using the sum() function has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
