# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
    import re
    l1 = []
    items = ['goal', 'new', 'user', 'sit', 'eat', 'dinner']
    
    for i in items:
        if not re.search(r"e", i):
            l1.append(i)
    print(l1)
## Output

## Result
The Python program to filter out words containing the letter 'e' using the re module has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
