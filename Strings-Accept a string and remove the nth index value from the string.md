# Module-3
# ðŸ§¹ Strings-Remove Nth Index Character from a String

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that accepts a string and removes the character at a specified index.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a function named `remove` that takes the input string as an argument.
2. Read the index `n` from the user input.
3. Initialize an empty string `a` to store the new string.
4. Iterate over each index of the string using a `for` loop.
5. Check if the current index `i` is not equal to `n`.
6. If `i != n`, append the character at index `i` to string `a`.
7. After the loop, return the modified string `a`.
8. Print the final result.

## ðŸ’» Program
                def remove(s):
                    n = int(input())
                    a = ""
                    for i in range(len(s)):
                        if i != n:
                            a += s[i]
                    return a
                
                input_string = input()
                print(remove(input_string))

## Result
The Python program to remove a character at a specific index from a string has been executed successfully, and the output has been verified.
